# My Assigment 2 - Gomoku Service

This project was build in a Windows environment. I chose this option as my work is windows based and I am going to start some basic web dev tasks and wanted to learn in the environment I will be working in. 

Please let me know if you come across any incompatibility issues. 

*Also please note I added some additional features to create a better user experience. Some features appear to deviate away from the assignment criteria but I assure you, the basic criteria is there, instead I just added more options. -->
